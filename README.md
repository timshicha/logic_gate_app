# Logic Gate App

This Logic Gate App is a tool that allows you to design logic circuits and test them with different inputs.
There are a couple notable features (or goal features):
1) Playground mode: This allows you to build circuits for fun, select desired inputs, and see what the outputs are.
2) Challenge mode: You are given a set of mappings (inputs to outputs). Your goal is to design a circuit that produces the given mappings.
